    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The term IoT refers to physical devices connected to a network
        like car keys and the corressponding car, or a smartwatch
        knowing your location, how far you ran, etc. All of these devices connect to the internet, have sensors,
        and software that allows them to collect and share data.
        These are also known as smart devices, and have many applications.

    <h2>What will we be covering and why?</h2>
    <p>As I was looking into this topic I saw all the cool subtopics this covers
        including Quantum smart devices, Edge and Fog Computing, which primarily
        talks about the cloud computing aspect of IoT's, and lastly context and location
        awareness, which deals with the type of data it collects depending on the location
        and other things.
